# Amenability Constant Of the center of group algebra for finite groups

The notion of amenability of Banach algebras initiated by Johnson's memoirs in which he showed that for every amenable group G, its group algebra is amenable and vice versa. 
Later, it was observed that this does not hold if one look at the centre of the group algebra. In

it was shown that for large classes of compact groups, including SU(2), the centre of the group algebra is not amenable. 

It is immediate that finite group have amenable centres for their group algebras. So one may wondering, while all the group algebra of finite groups have amenebaility constant one, what are the amenability constants of the centre of the group algebras for finite groups.
This constant will be denoted throughout by the ZL-amenability constant of G.
In the aforementioned paper, the authors provided a formula which computes the ZL-amenability constant of G for finite groups when only the character table of G is provided. In a subsequent paper, my coauthors and I studied some particular classes of (very) nilpotent groups and came up with simplified ZL-amenability constant formulas.

In this project, we first write a simple short code which reads the character table of a finite group as a and
